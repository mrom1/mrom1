### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael, a computer engineer from Germany. 

I have a passion for low-level coding, these days mostly in C++, in the past I worked in embedded software development for the German automotive industry. I have a particular interest in security, cryptography, reverse engineering, and modern C++ concepts.

Lately, I have been focusing more on topics like low-level networking, microservices, Internet of Things, and some front-end development mostly done with Vue.js. 

For the most part, this profile existed to help me keeping track of various side projects. As I got more and more requests from friends to show some sort of tutorial in reverse engineering and secure coding in general, I decided to revive this account publicly and keep you updated with various (legal!) challenges as well as their solutions. The first publication is planned to start sometime in June 2021, **so stay tuned!** ðŸ˜„
